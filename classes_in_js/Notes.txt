### Classes

In JavaScript, classes are a way to define blueprints for creating objects 
(these objects are different from the objects defined in the last section).




### Key Concepts

1. **Class Declaration**:
    - You declare a class using the `class` keyword.
    - Inside a class, you define properties (variables) and methods (functions) that will belong to the objects created from this class.

2. **Constructor**:
    - A special method inside the class that is called when you create an instance (an object) of the class.
    - It’s used to initialize the properties of the object.

3. **Methods**:
    - Functions that are defined inside the class and can be used by all instances of the class.

4. **Inheritance**:
    - Classes can inherit properties and methods from other classes, allowing you to create a new class based on an existing one.

5. **Static Methods**:
    - Methods that belong to the class itself, not to instances of the class. You call them directly on the class.

6. **Getters and Setters**:
    - Special methods that allow you to define how properties are accessed and modified.
